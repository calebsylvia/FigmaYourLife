      <h2>Crimson Moon</h2>
      <p>Crimson Moon is a very powerful move that I was able to pick up from my good friend Konro. It is so powerful that I was able to defeat a Demon Infernal. This is a big achievement of mine because it shows the immense power that is within myself, I use these abilities only when needed to protect my beloved Asakusa. The clip to the left is the one time I used it and as you can tell it is extremely powerful but was very necessary with the circumstances. I don't know the next time I will need to use this move but just know I have the power to use it again. </p>

          <h2>Former Captain of Company 7</h2>
          <p>One big achievement as mine is becoming the Captain of the Special Fire Force Company 7. Not only is this a big accomplishment I am also the strongest of all of the Captains. I don't use my powers as often as I used to but I still have the capability to be the strongest still. I had left the company to take care of Asakusa as their leader although I am a bit shy to be the leader of the town. </p>
